Data Science Assignment: eCommerce Transactions Dataset
Overview

This repository contains my submission for the Data Science Intern Assignment provided by Zeotap. The assignment involves analyzing an eCommerce Transactions dataset to derive insights, build predictive models, and perform customer segmentation. 

 Dataset Description
The dataset consists of three files:

1. Customers.csv
   - Contains details about customers such as ID, name, region, and signup date.

2.Products.csv
   - Contains product information like ID, name, category, and price.

3. Transactions.csv
   - Contains transactional data including transaction ID, customer ID, product ID, quantity, and total value.

 Tasks

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Conducted exploratory analysis to understand customer behavior, product performance, and transactional trends.
- Deliverables:
  - Python Notebook: Likitha_Baddepalli_EDA.ipynb
  - Report: Likitha_Baddepalli_EDA.pdf

2. Lookalike Model
- Built a model to find 3 similar customers for a given customer using profile and transactional data.
- Deliverables:
  - Python Notebook: Likitha_Baddepalli_Lookalike.ipynb
  - CSV Output: Likitha_Baddepalli_Lookalike.csv

3. Customer Segmentation / Clustering
- Performed customer segmentation using clustering techniques. 
- Evaluated clustering performance using metrics like the **DB Index and visualized the clusters.
- Deliverables:
  - Python Notebook: Likitha_Baddepalli_Clustering.ipynb
  - Report: Likitha_Baddepalli_Clustering.pdf

Key Highlights
- EDA: Discovered 5 key business insights and visualized trends using Python libraries.
- Lookalike Model: Developed a similarity-based recommendation system for customers.
- Clustering: Achieved optimal clusters and evaluated with the DB Index for performance.
